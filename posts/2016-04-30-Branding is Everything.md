### Branding is Everything

Before we build our product we build our brand, its important to be on brand on client facing touch points and internaly on team facing interfaces, our team members are in most cases the first we sale our brand to. 

Make sure you cover all of the next Brand Points before you launch your service.

## Logos

What is more important then our logo ? prepare and upload your logo to be place on all interfaces available as part of your White Lable, for client facing interfaces we dont have to tell you where and how to place your logo - this one is on you. 

On the management interfaces we are the one responsible and we will make sure your logo is looking sharp and representing your brand the way it should be.

## Email templates

Email comunication is the face of your company, from the first time the user signs up to your service those touch points are extremly important and the design should be on brand and inviting. 

The templates are divided to several types : 

* User facing templates
* Merchant facing templates 
* 3rd party notifications
* System notifications

All templates will be provided to you when you move into the Beta program, if you wish to gain early access to better prepare for Beta send us a note to Beta@coriunder.com and we will arrange that for you.

## Color schemes 

Besides setting up you logo you have the option to set the color schemes to the management interfaces so the look and feel will be more on brand. 

We will provide you with a CSS file to adjust the colors as needed - if no changes will be made the default Coriunder color scheme will apply. 

We use [Frontify](https://www.Frontify.com) to manage our brand book and color scheme - check it out.
