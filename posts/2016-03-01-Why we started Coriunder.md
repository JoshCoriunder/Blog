After years of assisting startups with building their solution, and seeing the struggels of setting up a backend or using multiple services to accomidate the needs of their company - all to see them eventualy run out of money and compremizing on the quality of the actual product they are offering.  


## The idea

Provide a backend system that will enable startups build their next big thing, focused on payments fintech companies can develop their niche product as a module on the Coriunder and benefit from an additional source of marketing making their module available to any costomer onboarded to the Coriunder platform.

### The start

Focused on fintech we decided that the best way to fulfill our vision is to base it on a payment gateway that has been proven and to modify it to our needs. 

The journy started with looking for the right fit for our needs, it was a long process but at the end we found what we were looking for, the process wasnt simple but we pushed through it and after months of development the base for our service was going live.

We have built our platform on Microsoft Azure after getting a lot of support from the local team in Cyprus and we were on way, all is left now is PCI certification and the platform will go live in January.

### Easy integration

We wanted to be better, simple and user friendly so we invested a lot of time and resources in upgrading the documentation for our new platform and preparing SDK and sample projects to better assist our clients with integrating to the system.

The Docs interface was built as the answer to all questions we ourselfs had when reviewing the platform for the first time, from developers to developers we wanted it be as simple as possible so not only developers will understand but also managers and dreamers trying to plan their next project.
