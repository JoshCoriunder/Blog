After years of assisting startups with building their solution, and seeing the struggles of setting up a backend system and using multiple services to accommodate the needs of their company - all to see them eventually run out of money and compromising on the quality of the actual product they are offering. 

### The problem

Fintech and ecommerce startups all need to build the same foundation to provide their services: 

* User management
* Merchant management
* Inventory management
* Integration to multiple Payment Providers
* Affiliate management

## The idea

Provide a backend system that will enable startups build their next big thing, focused on payments fintech companies can develop their niche product as a module on the Coriunder platform and benefit from an additional source of marketing making their module available to any customer onboarded to the Coriunder platform.

### The start

Focused on fintech we decided that the best way to fulfill our vision is to base it on a payment gateway that has been proven and to modify it to fit our needs. 

The journey started with looking for the right gateway to build our solution on top of, it was a long journey but at the end we found what we were looking for, the process wasn't simple but we pushed through it and after months of development the base for our service was going live.

We have built our platform on Microsoft Azure after getting a lot of support from the local team in Cyprus and we were on our way, all is left now is to get our own PCI certification and the platform will go live in January.

### Easy integration

We wanted to be better, simple and user friendly so we invested a lot of time and resources in upgrading the documentation for our new platform and preparing SDK and sample projects to better assist our clients with integrating to the system.

The Docs interface was built as the answer to all questions we ourselves had when reviewing the platform for the first time, from developers to developers we wanted it be as simple as possible so not only developers will understand it but also managers and dreamers trying to plan their next project.

### The Plan 

Provide full access to our staging cloud for developers to build their apps and services on top up, the move production should be simple as replacing a URL and that was exactly what we did. 

The price for accessing TheCloud you ask ? FREE - we want to encourage ideas and not limit them with budget concerns. 

Once you believe your app is ready to start testing it with live users we will promote you to the Beta program, when is Beta you will have your own subdomain and can start onboarding both merchant and users to YOUR platform, at this stage you will begin operating your own White Label version of our platform but it will be limited to a specific amount of users and merchants. 

The Beta program is not free given that from that moment we will be monitoring your activity and making sure you have all the tools you need to provide the best service to your end users.

### Launching your startup

The Beta period is not limited and you can stay here as long as you like, at some point you need to start planning your launch plans but don't think we wont help you there, once you are ready to go we will open a launch project with you and one of our experienced project managers will guide you and your team during the final stages of the launch plans. 

We will make sure all design elements are ready and slick enough for launch, all projects settings and links will be defined and all team members will have all the manuals they need to perform their duties. 

We will make sure you are dotting every "i" and crossing every "t" because there is no second chance for a first impression. 

Beyond this point we are in this together, you will handling the day to day activities by yourself but we will be here watching and making sure everything is running smoothly.
