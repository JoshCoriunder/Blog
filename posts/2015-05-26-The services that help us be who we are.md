The same as you, we are also a team of dreamers and developers who are building a startup and know the struggles we all face on our way to success. 

We wanted to share with you the services that help us keep the team on point and help speed things up.



## Jira

Jira is a task management system for development teams, the wide range of features gives us the control we need to manage our global development team. 

From time tracking to flow charts the wide range of 3rd party extensions gives us the flexibility we need to control the development road map.

## Bitbucket

Bitbucket is the GIT solution from Atlassian, we decided to use Bitbucket given the way that all of Atlassian services communicate with one another - the synergy between services allows the team to be updated live on every change in the system and make sure they are doing their part to support the effort. 

Bitbucket has proven to be a valuable service for our company and we believe that every team with developer working together around the world would enjoy working with it.

## Hipchat

Hipchat is not just another team chat app, the integration between Jira,Bitbucket and Hipchat helps keep the team up to speed with what is happening. 

When ever a team member completes a task or commit a change the team member the "Room" with him are updated on the change and can see the implications of that change.

The multiple 3rd party integrations on the Jira platform allow additional information to be shared with all team members withing the chats.
